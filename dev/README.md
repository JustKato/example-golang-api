# dev

## About
The `dev` folder represents a folder just for developer tools, this includes different docker configurations, scripts and many more things, this is a so caled "developer space" where we can put all those messy scripts into so that in the end when we send over to production we don't need to package our mess as well!

If you're going to make a mess, keep it organized :)

## [Docker](./docker)
The docker folder contains all of the docker-compose scripts for the different needs we might have such as a database for development purposes, now it's completely up to you what kind of docker container data, files, etc... 

## [Scripts](./scripts)
The scripts folder is a folder for you to throw in different scripts that aren't going to reach production, maybe you wanna throw in a script for testing, checking dev dependencies, etc..
