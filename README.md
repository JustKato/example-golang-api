# Example Golang API BackEnd

## About
This is an example project for using golang as a proper backend for an API, this project uses `gin` as well as using `mysql` as the database manager, there also is a docker image for the mysql database available for setup

## Purpose
This project exists just for the sole purpose of trying to create the best Example Project for really anyone to use, be it beginners, intermediates or even experts.

Maybe this can be used as a quick time saver, reference project or maybe even have some people contribute to it so much that we come in agreement what an API backend should look like.
