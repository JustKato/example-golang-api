# Example Golang API BackEnd

## About
This is an example project for using golang as a proper backend for an API, this project uses `gin` as well as using `mysql` as the database manager, there also is a docker image for the mysql database available for setup

## Purpose
This project exists just for the sole purpose of trying to create the best Example Project for really anyone to use, be it beginners, intermediates or even experts.

Maybe this can be used as a quick time saver, reference project or maybe even have some people contribute to it so much that we come in agreement what an API backend should look like.

## Disclaimer
This is just my take on the best practice, I tried to follow as many standards as I could and the best practices that I could find

You will find some pre-made logic, mostly boiler-plate, such as a login system using mySQL databases that includes structs in the structs folder structure. You can, of course, remove, edit or add new structs and logic depending on your needs; The Auth system I've implemented is extremely bare-bones but I tried to follow as many best practices to set a good example, feel free to completely remove it or modify it to your needs.
